### §1.1 No Binding Effect

Any Special Publication made under §1 of this Publication has no binding effect on the LCS Project, any implementor or user of any Publication made by the LCS Project, or any other group.

## §2 Information/Commentary Recommendations

The following provides non-binding recommendations for when a Working Committee should make a Special Publication under §1. 

### §2.1 Commentary - Contentious or Special Decisions

Where a Working Committee reviews, makes, or approves for publication a Special Publication or a Draft Publication, that contains a decision that was contentious, or required substantial consideration by the Working Committee, the Working Committee should make a Special Publication explaining the options it considered and the reasoning for the decision it reached.

### §2.2 Advisory - Security Recommendations

Wherein any Binding Publication or portion thereof is discovered to present a possible security risk, or may require special security considerations, where the Working Committee cannot efficiently modify the publication to correct it, the Working Committee should make a Special Publication advising any implementator or user of the Publication of the risk, and any mitigation steps known to be necessary or effective.
